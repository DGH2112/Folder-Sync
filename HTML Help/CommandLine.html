    <h1>Command Line Switches for FldrSyncCmd</h1>

    <p>I have provided a command line version of folder sync that allow you to
    compare a single pair of folders. This allows folder sync to be embedded in
    a batch process, something that was difficult with the GUI version.</p>

    <pre>FldrSyncCmd D:\Path\filepattern D:\Path\ [ /PrimaryLeft ] [ /PrimaryRight]
  [ /ConfirmYes ] [ /ConfirmNo ] [ /OverwriteREADONLY ] [ /Quiet ] [ /Update ]
  [ /NoRecursion ] [ /EExclusionList ] [ /! ] [ /? ]
    </pre>

    <p>The command line version thats 2 parameters which depict the left (first)
    and right (second) folders of the comparison. It also take one or more of
    the following swicthes (all swicthes can start with either a forward slash
    or a hyphen):</p>

    <table class="Commands">
      <tr>
        <th>Switch</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/PrimaryLeft</td>
        <td>This makes the first folder which is the left folder the primary
        source of information such that the right folder will be updated to
        match the left folder.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/PrimaryRight</td>
        <td>This makes the second folder which is the right folder the primary
        source of information such that the left folder will be updated to
        match the right folder.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/ConfirmYes</td>
        <td>By default you will be asked to confirm any deletion or overwriting
        of files. This option allow you to answer Yes to all actions and not be
        prompted. (Note: you need to use this is conjunction with the
        /OverwriteREADONLY switch to over write read only files with
        non-read-only files.)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/ConfirmNo</td>
        <td>By default you will be asked to confirm any deletion or overwriting
        of files. This option allow you to answer No to all actions and not be
        prompted.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/OverwriteREADONLY</td>
        <td>This option is require to allow the overwriting of read only files
        with non-read-only files without being prompted.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/Quiet</td>
        <td>This option suppresses some of the screen output which is useful
        when re-directing the console output to a text file.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/Update</td>
        <td>This options forces the checking for updates on the internet.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/NoRecursion</td>
        <td>This option disables the recursion of the sub-folder structures.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/E...</td>
        <td>This options allows you to specify a semi-colon delimited list of
        exclusoins to be used against the full path of the file. There should be
        no spece between the E and the text. You may need to put double quotes
        around some text.<br/>
        Example:
        <pre>/ESource;Tests;__history</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/!</td>
        <td>This option is used generally for debugging but will pause the
        completion of the application. To finish just press &lt;Enter>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/?</td>
        <td>This options displays this help screen.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The file pattern can either be left blank (all files) or a semi-colon
    separated list of file filters which can include the asterisk and question
    mark wildcards. You only need to specify this on the first (left) folder.</p>

    <p>You can specify the switches in any order.</p>
