    <h1>Compare</h1>

    <p>This action allows you to compare the contents of the two files currently
    selected in the list view with the comparison tools that you must have
    previously configured in the <a href="ToolsOptions.html">Options</a>
    dialogue.</p>

    <p>This is only generally useful for text files.</p>

    <p>Two double quoted parameters are passed to the comparison tool as left
    and right files respectively.</p>
