## Overview

This is a fairly old application. It contains both GUI and commandline application to synchronise the
files between 2 directories.

## Use

Please refer to the included HTML Help file.

## Current Limitations

The copy process does not perform any verification process (windows FileCopyEx is used).

## Binaries

There are currently no binaries available has this project is still in-progress so you will have to build
the project to get a binary (I'm using 10.3 Rio). Note: The main form uses some custom components which
you will not have installed (but you have source for) so do not open the main form to compile until I've
replaced them with dynamic creation in code or publish a component package for them.
