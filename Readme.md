## Binaries

There are currently no binaries available has this project is still in-progress so you will have to build
the project to get a binary (I'm using 10.3 Rio). Note: The main form uses some custom components which
you will not have installed (but you have source for) so do not open the main form to compile until I've
replaced them with dynamic creation in code or publish a component package for them.
